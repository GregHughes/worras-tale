# Worra's Tale

A simple 2D top-down shooter built with JavaScript and the [Phaser Game Engine](https://phaser.io/).

## Special Thanks

Matt McFarlands [phaser state management tutorial](https://github.com/MattMcFarland/phaser-menu-system) was a great reference.

## Pick up your bow and prepare for battle!
